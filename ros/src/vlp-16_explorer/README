Simple example used to read Velodyne 16 data.

Use:

First, untar the code inside the src directory in your ROS workspace. Build it using
   $ catkin_make
Once that your code is built successfully, you can run it directly, just for a quick test:
   $ ./devel/lib/vlp-16_explorer/vlp-16_explorer_node

Don't run it yet; follow the following sequence

1) In one terminal run
   $ roscore
2) Open a second terminal to define a parameter containing name of the topic which contains Velodyne data
   $ rosparam set /vlp16_explorer/vlp16_topic /velodyne_points
3) Confirm that the parameter is stored in the parameter server using
   $ rosparam list

4) Go back to the terminal where you built your code and run it

5) Open another terminal to replay bag file with VLP-16 data
   $ rosbag play 2018-01-19-10-56-08.bag

5) If all is well you should see that your code reads each frame and reports the number of points.
